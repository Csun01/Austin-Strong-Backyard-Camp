## Austin Strong Backyard Camp 

### Mission

* We want to provide young children the opportunity to form meaningful connections through an in-person backyard camp. 
* With this connection, away from electronics outside, we hope to foster their social skills and emotional development through gardening, STEM, music, and outdoor games. 
* After this twelve weeks long camp, we want to see that they are well prepared for in-person classes in the fall. 
* Some of them have never attended in-person school before, so this camp serves as a seed for young children to grow the "Austin Strong spirit." Whatever the new normal or new challenge may be, they are loved, supported, and will be strong to overcome it.
