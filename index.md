## 2021 Austin Strong Backyard Camp

### Mission

* We want to provide young children the opportunity to form meaningful connections through an in-person backyard camp. 
* With this connection, away from electronics outside, we hope to foster their social skills and emotional development through gardening, STEM, music, and outdoor games. 
* After this twelve weeks long camp, we want to see that they are well prepared for in-person classes in the fall. 
* Some of them have never attended in-person school before, so this camp serves as a seed for young children to grow the "Austin Strong spirit." Whatever the new normal or new challenge may be, they are loved and supported by us and will be strong to overcome it.
